                <p className="pb-8">I recently graduated from Savitiribai Phule Pune University after completing Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering</p>
                <p className="pb-8">As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.
                    My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>
                <p className="pb-8">When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably reading books, travelling or playing video games. </p>
